## About

ZFS Backup Blob is a tool for backing up ZFS filesystems to blob storages.
It tries to be simple to use and limited in the use-cases it supports.

ZFS Backup Blob was created since running a zfs backup server adds a lot of complexity. Adding a bucket in a s3 compatible blob storage is just a click.
