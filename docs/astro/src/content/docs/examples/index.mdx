## Setting up your configuration file

Before you are able to use any of the cli commands, you need to set up your configuration file in `.bbackup.yaml` in your home directory.

A basic version would be:

```yaml
stages:
  s3:
    type: s3
    bucket: <bucket>
    region: <region>
    accessKey: <accessKey>
    accessSecret: <accessSecret>
  zfs:
    type: zfs
    remote: s3
```

if you need throttling or encryption you can add this with [stages](/configuration/stages/)

further documentation about the [config file](/configuration/config-file/).

## Adding a volume to a backup group

Given you have a `pool/volume` and you want to add them to a backup group `my-group`. If you dont need more then one group you can omit the `--group` flag and the volume is assigned to the default group.

```bash
zfs-backup-blob group add-volume --volume pool/volume --group my-group
```

further documentation about [add volume](/cli/zfs-backup-blob_group_add-volume/).

## List volumes which belong to backup groups

Given you want to find out which zfs volumes you are making backups of.

```bash
zfs-backup-blob group list-volumes
```

this yields something like:

```bash
+------------------------------+---------+
| VOLUME                       | GROUP   |
+------------------------------+---------+
| pool/volume                  | default |
+------------------------------+---------+
```

further documentation about [list volumes](/cli/zfs-backup-blob_group_list-volumes/).

## Creating snapshots

Given you want to create backups of your zfs volumes in a backup group.

Then the first step is to create zfs snapshots and tag them with the type (full or incremental).

:::note
Zfs snapshots are not created atomically across volumes. The snapshots stay local until you decide to push them to the blob storage with the sync command.
:::

Given you have two volumes in a backup group `my-group` and you want to create a full snapshot of them. The following command would create two zfs snapshots.

```bash
zfs-backup-blob group snapshot --group my-group --type full
```

further documentation about [snapshots](/cli/zfs-backup-blob_group_snapshot/).

## Uploading snapshots to the blob storage

Given you have a backup group `my-group` and you want to push the snapshots to the blob storage.

:::note
This command will take all accumulated snapshots since the last sync and upload them to the blob storage.
It's up to you if you execute this command right after the snapshots command or if you delay it to a later point in time.
:::

```bash
zfs-backup-blob group sync --group my-group
```

further documentation about [syncing](/cli/zfs-backup-blob_group_sync/).

## Viewing backups of a volume

Given you want to find out how many backups are stored on the blob storage for a volume.

```bash
zfs-backup-blob backup list --volume pool/volume
```

will yield something like:

```bash
+------------------------------------+------+-------+
| KEY                                | TYPE | SIZE  |
+------------------------------------+------+-------+
| pool/volume                        | full | 111MB |
+------------------------------------+------+-------+
```

the `key` can be used to restore the particular backup.

## Restoring a Backup

Given you have a `pool/volume` and a `backup_blob_2024-08-11T00-10-01Z` was created and uploaded to the blob storage.

If you restore it with the command below, it will create a new volume `pool/restored-volume` with the content of the backup.

```bash
zfs-backup-blob backup restore --blob-key pool/volume/backup_blob_2024-08-11T00-10-01Z --target pool/restored-volume
```
