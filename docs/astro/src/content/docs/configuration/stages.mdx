import {Code} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Stages are away to define the flow from the source (**zfs**) to the sink (**s3**) while allowing to specify middlewares in a pipeline like styles.

Stages are defined in the [config file](/configuration/config-file/).

The type field corresponds to the type of stage and must be set for every stage.

## S3 Stage

import s3 from '../../yaml/s3-stage.yaml?raw';

<Code code={s3} lang="yaml"/>

| baseEndpoint   | The s3 api endpoint (set if you are using a s3 compatible api like backblaze)                                                                                   | no       |
| usePathStyle   | Set this to true if your compatible api needs path style urls                                                                                                   | no       |

| maxRetries     | The maximum amount of retries to perform for requests to the s3 api.                                                                                            | no       |
| uploadPartSize | The size of the parts to upload to s3 in bytes. Its recommended to increase this depending on your bandwidth (the higher the bandwidth the higher the partSize) | no       |

:::note
It's recommended to configure the s3 stage explicitly with the config. Configuration of the s3 sdk via environment variables is only an escape hatch.
