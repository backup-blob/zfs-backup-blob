Trim policies are used to delete old backups and local snapshots. They help to save disk space remote and locally.

:::note
A trim policy is a string of characters. Each character represents a backup type.

`F` for full backups/snapshots

`I` for incremental backups/snapshots
:::

:::note
The policy applies FIFO (first in first out) to the backups/snapshots. Older snapshots/backups are deleted first.
:::

:::note
The arrangement of the characters does not matter. Example: `FIFIF` is the same as `IIIFFF`.

## Remote Trim Policy

The remote trim policy deletes backups on the blob storage to free up space.

It can be configured via the `remote_trim_policy` field in the [config file](/configuration/config-file/).

#### Example Policy:

```yaml
remote_trim_policy: IFIFIF
```

**Translates to:** Always keep the last 3 full backups and the last 3 incremental backups.

#### How to execute a remote trim policy

Run the [trim-remote command](/cli/zfs-backup-blob_group_trim-remote/) to execute a remote trim policy for a group.


## Local Trim Policy

The local trim policy deletes snapshots locally to free up space.

It can be configured via the `local_trim_policy` field in the [config file](/configuration/config-file/).

#### Example Policy:

```yaml
local_trim_policy: FFFF
```

**Translates to:** Always keep the last 4 full backups/snapshots.
