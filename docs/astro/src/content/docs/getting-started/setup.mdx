This example shows how to back up a ZFS volume to S3.

:::note
This example assumes you have a ZFS pool named `zfs-pool` and a volume named `volume1`.
:::



1. Create a `.bbackup.yaml` in your home directory.

```yaml
stages:
  s3:
    type: s3
    bucket: <bucket>
    region: <region>
    accessKey: <accessKey>
    accessSecret: <accessSecret>
  zfs:
    type: zfs
    remote: s3
```

2. Add a volume to a backup group.

```bash
zfs-backup-blob group add-volume --volume zfs-pool/volume1
```

3. Create full snapshot of volumes belonging to the backup group.

```bash
zfs-backup-blob group snapshot --type full
```

4. Sync snapshots to remote storage (s3 in this case).

```bash
zfs-backup-blob group sync
```

5. Verify snapshots are backed up in remote blob storage.

```bash
zfs-backup-blob backup list --volume zfs-pool/volume1
```
